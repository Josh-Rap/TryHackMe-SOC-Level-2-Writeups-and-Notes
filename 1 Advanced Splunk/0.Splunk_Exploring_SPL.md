## Room Goals:
- What are Search processing Language?
- How to apply filters to narrow down results.
- Using transformational commands.
- Changing the order of the results.

## Notes

SPL Comments: enclose in "```"

#### Filtering Results
`index=windowslogs | fields + host + User + SourceIp`
- spell the fields correctly (case sensitive)

`index=windowslogs | search Powershell`
- search raw text with pipe

`dedup`
- remove duplicate fields

`rename XYZ as ABC`
- change name of field XYZ to ABC

#### Structuring Results
`| table <field_name1> <fieldname_2>`

#### Transforming Searches
`| top limit=<#> <field_name>`
- frequent values
`| rare limit=<#>> <field_name>`
- opposite of `top`, rare values

`highlight <field_name1> <field_name2>`
- highlight fields in raw events mode
