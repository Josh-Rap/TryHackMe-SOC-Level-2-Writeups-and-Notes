# TryHackMe-SOC-Level-2-Writeups-and-Notes
This repository contains my notes and writeups from the TryHackMe SOC Level 2 learning path. After completing SOC Level 1 last year and gaining valuable experience in triaging alerts, monitoring logs, and configuring security tools, I am now expanding my skills in advanced Blue Teaming tasks.

SOC Level 2 focuses on in-depth log analysis, detection engineering, threat hunting, incident response, and malware analysis, all through hands-on, realistic scenarios. These notes serve as a reference for my learning. I'll note down my answers for exercises and how I got those answers, as well as anything else I find useful or interesting.
